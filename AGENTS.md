# Droid Configuration

This file contains project-specific configuration for Droid.

## Context
- Project: NoteD — FPS Input Training & Analysis Tool
- Description: A tool to help FPS players monitor and analyze their input movements (keyboard, mouse) to improve mechanics like counterstrafing and deadzoning
- Language: TBD (to be decided during OpenSpec planning)

## Rules
- Follow the coding conventions defined in the skills library.
- Use OpenSpec for all feature planning — run `/opsx:new` before writing code.
- Keep systems modular (input capture, analysis, visualization, data storage).
- Write tests for core input capture and analysis logic.
- Prioritize low-latency input monitoring for accuracy.
