  Project: NoteD — FPS Input Training & Analysis Tool
  
  Purpose: Help FPS players monitor and analyze their input movements
  (keyboard presses, mouse clicks/movement) to improve mechanics like
  counterstrafing and deadzoning.
  
  Tech stack: TBD (will be decided during the first OpenSpec change).
  
  Conventions:
  - Use OpenSpec for all feature planning before implementation
  - Keep systems modular (input capture, analysis, visualization, data storage)
  - Markdown for documentation, YAML for configuration
  - Descriptive filenames in kebab-case

rules:
  proposal:
    - Clearly state which system(s) are affected (input, analysis, UI, etc.)
    - Include a "Non-goals" section to keep scope tight
  specs:
    - Use Given/When/Then format for user interaction scenarios
    - Reference existing system specs when adding cross-cutting features
  design:
    - Document performance considerations for real-time input capture
    - Consider latency impact on input monitoring accuracy
  tasks:
    - Break into chunks that can be tested independently
    - Prioritize core input capture before analysis features
